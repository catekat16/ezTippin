# Pre-work - *ezTippin*

**ezTippin** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Caitlyn Chen**

Time spent: **2.5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [X] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Split the bill with friends
- [X] Visually appealing gradient background
- [ ] Can enter custom tip percentage value and number of ways to split in the segmentedcontrol
- [ ] Round up and round down buttons
- [ ] Can choose between different themes/moods for the colors of the app in settings view
- [ ] Can choose local customs for tipping and select type of service (delivery, takeout, restaurant), to determine standard tip percentage
- [ ] App icons
- [ ] Compatible with all device types and sizes
- [ ] Can see suggestions of coin/bill breakdowns with images of what each coin/bill looks like next to the corresponding value, which would help travelers not familiar with the local currency (traveler mode in settings, pay with cash or credit card options)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

TODO's:
1) - indicate tip value below bill value
2) - implement X and X%
3) - have cursor be displayed immediately when user opens app
4) - settings screen to save default values
5) - dollar sign in the bill total text field
6) - round up and round down buttons
7) - #neon, #ocean, #violetlights color background views
8) - design ezTippin gradient app icon (kind of like Instagram's)
